Project Name: A Story of Refuge

Project Description: 

A story of refuge shows the sad reality of the sudden actions that happen with refugees when they have to leave their home. Through the different actions that appear without foreshadowing cues, the refugees are put in a situation where they do not have the option but to run away from their home.

In our story, in the beginning after the introduction music is played, we hear a sound of dinner being prepared and a father calling his son to come down for dinner which shows that life was peaceful and ordinary. Then, suddenly, someone knocks on the door intensely. When the father opens the door, his neighbor tells him that the village is being attacked and they need to leave.  Then an explosion takes place in distance, and the father calls the son to leave.

They start running towards the sea with the neighbor, with all of the war sounds in the background, and they get in on a boat to escape the war. Through the journey in the sea, the boat sinks, and a lot the refugees keep swimming. Just before they reach the land, the son checks if his father is around, and the neighbor tells him that he did not make it. At the end a sad patriotic song is played, as closing that talks about how the homeland will be missed.

Process: 

To deliver our story in the clearest manner, we built our webpage in a minimalist fashion. Upon landing on our webpage, visitors will find a title, a square box, audio control options, a link to a different page, and a footer.

Initially, colors throughout the webpage are within dark shades of grey. It foreshadows not-too-happy mood of the story. When visitors click “> Experience <”, the audio will start playing, and the color of a square box and the webpage background color will start changing depending on which part of the scene visitors are experiencing trying to convey different emotions and impressions. For example, the story starts with a family preparing for dinner, and the color becomes a warm color (orange-yellow) to signify a peaceful and happy moment of a family. When the family hears that their village is under attack and they need to evacuate, the color changes into an alerting red.

Throughout the experience, visitors will have the capacity to pause, mute, open a new tab and do something else. However, we implemented designs to send “do not look away” message (to be clear, “do not look away from refuge issues”). When paused or muted, a big red message will appear in the header (navigation bar), and when the page loses focus (when other windows/tabs are opened or selected), the tab title will ask whether the visitor is “looking away”.

While the audio is playing, visitors have the option to go to a “Story” tab to read about the plot and background of the story. While doing so, the audio remains uninterrupted. The background behind the text is still a dark grey, but a bit brighter than the main page for readability.

Reflection/Evaluation:

We initially found it difficult to work as a team, considering the time constraint and the inability to meet up with all team members in person. However, the number of people on campus was just enough to record nice audio to tell our story, whereas Joonha alongside Saad were working on making the website to host our audio story. With Saad, Youssef, and Nurgazy working on recording and finding the sound effects, and also Saad and Joonha on the website, we were able to work together to create the initial framework of the project. After we have gotten the first feedback on our website design and audio, our team decided to refine the sound to be more smooth and the webpage to be more dynamic and responsive. One of the challenges that Saad and Joonha came across as they were perfecting the website was figuring out different emotional cues triggered by various colors. Unfortunately, no one of our team had artistic background or exceptional artistic sense. To solve the problem, they researched the color relations to feelings and emotions to choose the corresponding ones which would match the vibe of the story. Then they took time marks of the audio and assigned respective colors to them.
