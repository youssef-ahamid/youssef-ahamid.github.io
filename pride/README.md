The title of our interactive comic is “Pride (And How To React To Your Child Coming Out)”.

The plot tells the story of a young man who happily embraces his identity as a homosexual man; however, he still does not know how to tell his parents. After finding a poster for an LGBTQ+ party in his bedroom, the parents confront their son and demand to know the truth. The user is given the choice to be either the boy or the parents, and his/her choices will affect how the plot will play out. In addition, there are some hidden sound effects that can be played throughout the comic when clicked on. 

We aimed to create an educational and immersive experience for the user, which allows them to dive into the perspectives of both the parent and the child. Through not giving the main characters names, it creates a more general experience for the user and allows them to be put in the shoes of the protagonists.  In addition, we wanted to portray how one’s sexual orientation is a big part of their identity. Through only adding color to the rainbow-colored bands and pink glow of those accepting of the LGBTQ+ community, this creates emphasis on the main message of the story. We used Adobe Illustrator to turn the drawings into SVG’s, and often used Adobe Photoshop to tweak the color correction of the photos to make them pop more.

We initially found it difficult to work as a team, considering the time constraint and the inability to meet up in person and talk about our assigned tasks. However, as time went on, we were able to better cooperate with one another and produce our final result. With Katie working on the drawings and finding the sound effects, Youssef on the storyline and responsiveness of the website, Nurgazy on the general structure of the website, and Yusra with the interactivity and the flow of the website, we were able to work together and meet our goals for the site.
